# PROPheT Ontology Populator 

Description
-------------
PROPheT is a novel application that enables **instance extraction** and **ontology population** from Linked Data, using a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). In PROPheT, concepts, i.e. realisations of entities, and relations populated in online Linked Data sources (such as *DBPedia*) can be located, filtered and inserted into a userâ€™s own domain ontology. 

PROPheT offers **three** types of instance extraction-related functionalities (*instance-based populating*, *class-based populating* and *instance enrichment*) along with **user-driven mapping** of data properties. It is flexible enough to work with any domain ontology (written in OWL) and any RDF Linked Data set that is available via a SPARQL endpoint. 

Features
-----------
PROPheT offers the following key features:
* Three modes of instance extraction-related functionalities.
* User-driven mapping of data properties.
* Importing a domain ontology (over HTTP or locally).
* Exporting the populated ontology in the most popular formats (.*owl*, .*rdf*, .*ttl*, .*nt* and .*n3*).
* Flexibility to seamlessly work with any domain ontology (written in OWL) and any Linked Data resource that is available via a SPARQL endpoint.
* Elimination of redundancy in the instance set by handling duplicates.
* User-friendly GUI with enriched display of content and information, as well as useful function utilities for the user.
